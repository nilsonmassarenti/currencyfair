# currencyfair
This project test Spring to receive a data of trades


To start the application execute App.java

It's not necessary use any application to execute, because I used Spring to control my rest requests.

When you execute, normally will use port 8080

To save data send information via rest to address http://localhost:8080/rest/currencyfair/create

To get all data via rest in address http://localhost:8080/rest/currencyfairs

To test use html message_processor.html in any web server and with the server change a line 46
